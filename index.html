      <textarea id='input' class='flex-child'>The Lightning Network, often abbreviated as "LN", is changing the way people exchange value online, and it's one of the most exciting advancements to happen in Bitcoin's history. Today, in 2021, the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. The Lightning Network is a protocol for using Bitcoin in a smart and non-obvious way. It is a second layer technology on top of Bitcoin.

The concept of the Lightning Network was proposed in 2015, and the first implementation was launched in 2018. As of 2021, we're only beginning to see the opportunities the Lightning Network provides to Bitcoin including improved privacy, speed, and scale. With core knowledge of the Lightning Network, you can help shape the future of the network while also building opportunities for yourself.
